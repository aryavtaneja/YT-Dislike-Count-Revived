# YT-Dislike-Count-Revived

**NOTE:** Since YouTube [has removed the ability to fetch dislike count from the API](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/134791097/update-to-youtube-dislike-counts?hl=en), **the extension does not work.** This repo is therefore inactive, but will be left up. This was meant as a way for me to learn how to make simple Chrome extensions, anyway.

## why?
After YouTube announced they were [hiding public dislike counts from videos](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/), I, like many, was miffed. YouTube was still, at least temporarily, allowing you to fetch dislike counts from the API. Therefore, I decided to take the plunge, learning to make Chrome extensions while improving my YouTube experience.

## how to install
The extension is no longer available on the Chrome Web Store. If you'd like to sideload it (for whatever reason), read on:

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/aryavtaneja/YT-Dislike-Count-Revived/releases/tag/releases) and download the latest one.
2. Unzip the .zip file.
3. In either Chrome or Edge, go to your Extensions page, and find the "Developer Mode" toggle. Turn it on.
4. Select "Load Unpacked", and select the folder where you unzipped the extension.

To reiterate, **the extension does not work anymore. Do not complain to me if it doesn't.**
