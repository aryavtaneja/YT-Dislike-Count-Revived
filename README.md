# YT-Dislike-Count-Revived

**NOTE:** Since YouTube [will be removing the ability to fetch dislike count from the API on December 13](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/134791097/update-to-youtube-dislike-counts?hl=en), **the extension will stop working after that.** I'll archive this repo when the date rolls around. This was meant as a way for me to learn how to make simple Chrome extensions, anyway.

## why?
After YouTube announced they were [hiding public dislike counts from videos](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/), I, like many, was miffed. YouTube was still, at least temporarily, allowing you to fetch dislike counts from the API. Therefore, I decided to take the plunge, learning to make Chrome extensions while improving my YouTube experience.

## how to install
The extension is available in the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dislike-count-revived/pjbpafkacplaleghiegjhkiebnafblhi?hl=en&authuser=1). If you'd like to sideload it instead for the latest version, read on:

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/aryavtaneja/YT-Dislike-Count-Revived/releases/tag/releases) and download the latest one.
2. Unzip the .zip file.
3. In either Chrome or Edge, go to your Extensions page, and find the "Developer Mode" toggle. Turn it on.
4. Select "Load Unpacked", and select the folder where you unzipped the extension.

The extension has been verified to work on Chrome and Edge. It should work on other Chromium-based browsers, but don't be angry if it doesn't, I haven't tested many.
